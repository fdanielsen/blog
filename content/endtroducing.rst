Endtroducing…

:summary: The first words of the blog that never started.

Hello, world! Famous first hacker words, famous last blog words [1]_? It's been
quite a few years thinking "I should get a blog up", with some failed
"down the rabbit hole" attempts, but hopefully we're all set for a fun ride
this time.

This will be my personal outlet – what else are blogs? – but the plan has not
been written yet. It will probably not have any sharp focus, at least not
sharper a focus than my life and thoughts (which can be quite blurry at times).

I will write about what interests me. Currently that may range from
programming, to food; wine; beer, or from music, to travelling and all the way to
my newly reignited interest of dressing like a grownup, to put it in the words
of `Put This On <http://putthison.com>`_.

Technically this is very much a work in progress, or an iterative process as
you might call it. I've got the basic engine up, running on Pelican_. As time
moves along and content is written, I hope to also mold a more personal design
too. And the content structure will very much be formed as I go along, typing
words into vim and saving it in files (sounds easy, doesn't it?).

And what do you know? We've already covered Python programming (with Pelican_),
and music [2]_.

Anyway, it's been nice meeting you, and I hope we meet again sometime soon.

.. [1] WordPress, one of the most used blogging platforms, comes with a
    pre-installed post titled "Hello, World!". `Google shows us`_ there's plenty of
    blogs with that post, and many probably never wrote any other posts after
    setting things up.
.. [2] The title shamelessly refers to the debut album `Endtroducing…`_ by `DJ Shadow`_.
